# serve

A basic HTTP file server in Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server)

### Features

* Fast
* Single binary
* Colourful logs with modifiable timestamps and response times
* Directory listing supporting multiple content types (`html`,`json` and `xml`) via the `Accept` header
* Directory downloads via on-demand `zip` and `tar` [archive](https://github.com/jpillora/archive)s
* Optional PushState (HTML5 History API) mode (missing directories returns the root)
* LiveReload (combines with [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en))
* Fallback proxy (missing requests defer to another server)

### Usage

  --port, -p        Listening port (default 3000)
  --livereload, -l  Enable LiveReload, a websocket server, which triggers 
                    page a refresh after each file change
  --pushstate       Enable PushState mode, causes missing directory paths 
                    will return the root index.html file, instead of returning

                    index.html or directory

                    without buffering)
  --quiet, -q       Disable all output
  --timefmt, -t     Timestamp format (default [2006-01-02 15:04:05.000] )
  --open, -o        On server startup, open the root in the default browser 
                    (uses the 'open' command)
  --fallback, -f    Requests that yeild a 404, will instead proxy through 
                    to the provided path (swaps in the appropriate Host 
                    header)
