# serve

A basic HTTP file server in Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/serve/server)

### Features

* Fast
* Single binary
* Colourful logs
* Displays response times
* Supports PushState URLs (missing directories returns the root)
* Supports LiveReload (useful with [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en))
* Supports a fallback proxy (missing files defer to another server)

### Usage

`serve --help`

<tmpl,code: go run main.go --help>
``` plain 

  Usage: serve [options] [directory]
  
  [directory] from which files will be served (default ./)
  
  Options:
  --host, -h        Host interface (default 0.0.0.0).
  --port, -p        Listening port (default 3000).
  --livereload, -l  Enable LiveReload, a websocket server, which triggers 
                    page a refresh after each file change.
  --pushstate       Enable PushState mode, causes missing directory paths 
                    will return the root index.html file, instead of returning 
                    a 404. This allows correct use of the HTML5 History API.

                    listening page in the default browse.
  --fallback, -f    A proxy path to request if a given request 404's. This 
                    allows you customize one file of a live site.
